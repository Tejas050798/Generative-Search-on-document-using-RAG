(2) On the ground of fraud, a Policy of Life Insurance may be called in question within 3 years from a. the date of issuance of Policy or b. the date of commencement of risk or c. the date of revival of Policy or d. the date of rider to the Policy whichever is later. For this, the insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which such decision is based. (3) Fraud means any of the following acts committed by insured or by his agent, with the intent to deceive the insurer or to induce the insurer to issue a life insurance Policy: a. The suggestion, as a fact of that which is not true and which the insured does not believe to be true; b. The active concealment of a fact by the insured having knowledge or belief of the fact; c. Any other act fitted to deceive; and d. Any such act or omission as the law specifically declares to be fraudulent. (4) Mere silence is not fraud unless, depending on circumstances of the case, it is the duty of the insured or his agent keeping silence to speak or silence is in itself equivalent to speak. (5) No Insurer shall repudiate a life insurance Policy on the ground of Fraud, if the Insured / beneficiary can prove that the misstatement was true to the best of his knowledge and there was no deliberate intention to suppress the fact or that such mis- statement of or suppression of material fact are within the knowledge of the insurer. Onus of disproving is upon the Policyholder, if alive, or beneficiaries. (6) Life insurance Policy can be called in question within 3 years on the ground that any statement of or suppression of a fact material to expectancy of life of the insured was incorrectly made in the proposal or other document basis which Policy was issued or revived or rider issued. For this, the insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which decision to repudiate the Policy of life insurance is based. (7) In case repudiation is on ground of mis-statement and not on fraud, the premium collected on Policy till the date of repudiation shall be paid to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, within a period of 90 days from the date of repudiation. (8) Fact shall not be considered material unless it has a direct bearing on the risk undertaken by the insurer. The onus is on insurer to show that if the insurer had been aware of the said fact, no life insurance Policy would have been issued to the insured. (9) The insurer can call for proof of age at any time if he is entitled to do so and no Policy shall be deemed to be called in question merely because the terms of the Policy are adjusted on subsequent proof of age of life insured. So, this Section will not be applicable for questioning age or adjustment based on proof of age submitted subsequently.

The extant provisions in this regard are as follows: (1) This Policy may be transferred/ assigned, wholly or in part, with or without consideration. (2) An Assignment may be effected in a Policy by an endorsement upon the Policy itself or by a separate instrument under notice to the Insurer. (3) The instrument of assignment should indicate the fact of transfer or assignment and the reasons for the assignment or transfer, antecedents of the assignee and terms on which assignment is made. (4) The assignment must be signed by the transferor or assignor or duly authorized agent and attested by at least one witness. (5) The transfer or assignment shall not be operative as against an insurer until a notice in writing of the transfer or assignment and either the said endorsement or instrument itself or copy there of certified to be correct by both transferor and transferee or their duly authorised agents have been delivered to the insurer. (6) Fee to be paid for assignment or transfer can be specified by the Authority through Regulations. (7) On receipt of notice with fee, the insurer should Grant a written acknowledgement of receipt of notice. Such notice shall be conclusive evidence against the insurer of duly receiving the notice. (8) If the insurer maintains one or more places of business, such notices shall be delivered only at the place where the Policy is being serviced. (9) The insurer may accept or decline to act upon any transfer or assignment or endorsement, if it has sufficient reasons to believe that it is a. not bonafide or b. not in the interest of the Policyholder or c. not in public interest or d. is for the purpose of trading of the insurance Policy. (10) Before refusing to act upon endorsement, the Insurer should record the reasons in writing and communicate the same in writing to Policyholder within 30 days from the date of Policyholder giving a notice of transfer or assignment. (11) In case of refusal to act upon the endorsement by the Insurer, any person aggrieved by the refusal may prefer a claim to IRDAI within 30 days of receipt of the refusal letter from the Insurer. (12) The priority of claims of persons interested in an insurance Policy would depend on the date on which the notices of assignment or transfer is delivered to the insurer; where there are more than one instruments of transfer or assignment, the priority will depend on dates of delivery of such notices. Any dispute in this regard as to priority should be referred to Authority. (13) Every assignment or transfer shall be deemed to be absolute assignment or transfer and the assignee or transferee shall be deemed to be absolute assignee or transferee, except a. where assignment or transfer is subject to terms and conditions of transfer or assignment OR b. where the transfer or assignment is made upon condition that i. the proceeds under the Policy shall become payable to Policyholder or nominee(s) in the event of assignee or transferee dying before the insured OR ii. the insured surviving the term of the Policy. Such conditional assignee will not be entitled to obtain a loan on Policy or surrender the Policy. This provision will prevail notwithstanding any law or custom having force of law which is contrary to the above position. (14) In other cases, the insurer shall, subject to terms and conditions of assignment, recognize the transferee or assignee named in the notice as the absolute transferee or assignee and such person a. shall be subject to all liabilities and equities to which the transferor or assignor was subject to at the date of transfer or assignment and b. may institute any proceedings in relation to the Policy c. obtain loan under the Policy or surrender the Policy without obtaining the consent of the transferor or assignor or making him a party to the proceedings. (15) Any rights and remedies of an assignee or transferee of a life insurance Policy under an assignment or transfer effected before commencement of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 shall not be affected by this section.\",\n          \"HDFC Life Smart Pension Plan 101L164V02 \\u2013 Terms and Conditions (Direct & Online Sales) (A Unit Linked Non-Participating Individual Pension Plan) PART G GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL MECHANISM, LIST OF OMBUDSMAN AND OTHER ANNEXURES G.1.

The extant provisions in this regard are as follows: (1) This Policy may be transferred/ assigned, wholly or in part, with or without consideration. (2) An Assignment may be effected in a Policy by an endorsement upon the Policy itself or by a separate instrument under notice to the Insurer. (3) The instrument of assignment should indicate the fact of transfer or assignment and the reasons for the assignment or transfer, antecedents of the assignee and terms on which assignment is made. (4) The assignment must be signed by the transferor or assignor or duly authorized agent and attested by at least one witness. (5) The transfer or assignment shall not be operative as against an insurer until a notice in writing of the transfer or assignment and either the said endorsement or instrument itself or copy there of certified to be correct by both transferor and transferee or their duly authorised agents have been delivered to the insurer. (6) Fee to be paid for assignment or transfer can be specified by the Authority through Regulations. (7) On receipt of notice with fee, the insurer should Grant a written acknowledgement of receipt of notice. Such notice shall be conclusive evidence against the insurer of duly receiving the notice. (8) If the insurer maintains one or more places of business, such notices shall be delivered only at the place where the Policy is being serviced. (9) The insurer may accept or decline to act upon any transfer or assignment or endorsement, if it has sufficient reasons to believe that it is a. not bonafide or b. not in the interest of the Policyholder or c. not in public interest or d. is for the purpose of trading of the insurance Policy. (10) Before refusing to act upon endorsement, the Insurer should record the reasons in writing and communicate the same in writing to Policyholder within 30 days from the date of Policyholder giving a notice of transfer or assignment. (11) In case of refusal to act upon the endorsement by the Insurer, any person aggrieved by the refusal may prefer a claim to IRDAI within 30 days of receipt of the refusal letter from the Insurer. (12) The priority of claims of persons interested in an insurance Policy would depend on the date on which the notices of assignment or transfer is delivered to the insurer; where there are more than one instruments of transfer or assignment, the priority will depend on dates of delivery of such notices. Any dispute in this regard as to priority should be referred to Authority. (13) Every assignment or transfer shall be deemed to be absolute assignment or transfer and the assignee or transferee shall be deemed to be absolute assignee or transferee, except a. where assignment or transfer is subject to terms and conditions of transfer or assignment OR b. where the transfer or assignment is made upon condition that i. the proceeds under the Policy shall become payable to Policyholder or nominee(s) in the event of assignee or transferee dying before the insured OR ii. the insured surviving the term of the Policy. Such conditional assignee will not be entitled to obtain a loan on Policy or surrender the Policy. This provision will prevail notwithstanding any law or custom having force of law which is contrary to the above position. (14) In other cases, the insurer shall, subject to terms and conditions of assignment, recognize the transferee or assignee named in the notice as the absolute transferee or assignee and such person a. shall be subject to all liabilities and equities to which the transferor or assignor was subject to at the date of transfer or assignment and b. may institute any proceedings in relation to the Policy c. obtain loan under the Policy or surrender the Policy without obtaining the consent of the transferor or assignor or making him a party to the proceedings. (15) Any rights and remedies of an assignee or transferee of a life insurance Policy under an assignment or transfer effected before commencement of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 shall not be affected by this section.\",\n          \"HDFC Life Smart Pension Plan 101L164V02 \\u2013 Terms and Conditions (Direct & Online Sales) (A Unit Linked Non-Participating Individual Pension Plan) PART G GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL MECHANISM, LIST OF OMBUDSMAN AND OTHER ANNEXURES G.1.

(2) On the ground of fraud, a Policy of Life Insurance may be called in question within 3 years from a. the date of issuance of Policy or b. the date of commencement of risk or c. the date of revival of Policy or d. the date of rider to the Policy whichever is later. For this, the insurer should communicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as applicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which such decision is based. (3) Fraud means any of the following acts committed by insured or by his agent, with the intent to deceive the insurer or to induce the insurer to issue a life insurance Policy: a.
